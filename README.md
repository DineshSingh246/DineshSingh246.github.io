green screen composition according to your need, the image filter works on a 
single image and you can choose from a variety of filters for eg. Grayscale, 
rainbow etc. Green screen composition works on green screen algorithm where 
user needs to provide two pictures and if there is a green background found in 
image, that pixel is changed by the background image and the resulting image is 
displayed on the first canvas. You can use any type of image file and it will only 
accept image file type. Image Filter has one canvas 
and image is drawn on it and you can perform different filters according to your 
choice and you can reset or clear the canvas if needed. Green Screen Composite 
helps in generating a picture removing pixels or part of the foreground image by 
background image if there green component in a value greater then threshold 
value and the resulting image is drawn on the foreground canvas with the desired 
results.
